## Overview
The Deforestation Driver and Carbon Emission (DeDuCE) model amalgamates remotely sensed datasets with extensive agricultural statistics to estimate deforestation attributable to agricultural and forestry activities globally. Developed utilizing Google Earth Engine and Python, DeDuCE comprehensively covers over 9100 unique country-commodity combinations across 176 countries and 184 commodities within the specified period, presenting an unmatched scope and granularity of data. The dataset generated by the model provides country-level estimates of agriculture and forestry-driven deforestation and associated carbon emissions for the period 2001-2022, with sub-national level attribution available for Brazil. 

## Documentation and data
The manuscript detailing the model is currently archived at In-Review: **_Singh, C., & Persson, U. M. (2024). Global patterns of commodity-driven deforestation and associated carbon emissions_**.

The input and generated data by the model is available at **Zenodo**: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10674962. 


## GitHub repository contents
To replicate our analysis, the model need to be run in the following order:
- `1. Deforestation attribution (GEE)-Spatial`: Employs the Earth Engine Python API for spatial deforestation attribution, leveraging Google Earth Engine's extensive data and computational power (to be used as input for statistical deforestation attribution). More information about [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install). 
- `2. Data visualisation (Spatial attribution)`: Analysis of spatial attribution estimates.
- `3. Analysing gross crop and grass loss`: Gross crop and grass loss following the methodology by [Li et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-219-2018) (to be used as input for statistical deforestation attribution).
- `4. Deforestation attribution (Python)-Statistical`: Statistical deforestation attribution, estimation of carbon emissions and quality assessment.
- `5. Data analysis and visualisation`: All data analyses presented in the study.
- `Troubleshooting`: For troubleshooting spatial and statistical deforestation attribution code.


## System requirement
### OS requirement
The model is not restricted to a specific operating system. Although we conducted our tests on a Linux system, it is fully compatible with Windows and MacOS, provided your computer supports **Python (version 3.10.12)**.

### Processing time
**Google Earth Engine (GEE)**: GEE imposes usage limits to ensure equitable resource distribution among its users. Running the DeDuCE model's spatial attribution script (`1. Deforestation attribution (GEE)-Spatial`), requires approximately **198 hours** for a standard user privilege account for a single cycle of global spatial attribution.  

**Python**: Executing the statistical attribution script (`4. Deforestation attribution (Python)-Statistical`) on a Linux server configured for `multiprocessing` — allowing the task to be distributed across multiple CPUs — the processing time is about **3 hours** for it to complete a single cycle. The Linux server is equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz, featuring 48 CPUs and 252 GB RAM.   

However, when the same Python code is run on a personal computer with a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1265U @1.80 GHz processor and 32 GB RAM, it takes around **50 hours** for it to complete a single cycle.
