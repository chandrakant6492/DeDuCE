## Overview
The Deforestation Driver and Carbon Emission (DeDuCE) model amalgamates remotely sensed datasets with extensive agricultural statistics to estimate deforestation attributable to agricultural and forestry activities globally. Developed utilizing Google Earth Engine and Python, DeDuCE comprehensively covers over 9100 unique country-commodity combinations across 176 countries and 184 commodities within the specified period, presenting an unmatched scope and granularity of data. The dataset generated by the model provides country-level estimates of agriculture and forestry-driven deforestation and associated carbon emissions for the period 2001-2022, with sub-national level attribution available for Brazil. 

## Documentation and data
The manuscript detailing the model is currently archived at In-Review: Singh, C. and Persson U.M. Global patterns of commodity-driven deforestation and associated carbon emissions. Please cite this preprint when citing this model.       
The data generated by the model is available at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10674962.

## System requirement
### OS requirement
The model is not restricted to a specific operating system. Although we conducted our tests on a Linux system, it is fully compatible with Windows and MacOS, provided your computer supports Python (version 3.10.12).

### Processing time
**Google Earth Engine (GEE)**: GEE imposes usage limits to ensure equitable resource distribution among its users. Running the DeDuCE model's spatial attribution script (`1. Deforestation attribution (GEE)-Spatial`), requires approximately **198 hours** for a standard user privilege account for a single cycle (global spatial attribution).  

**Python**: Executing the statistical attribution script (`4. Deforestation attribution (Python)-Statistical`), on a personal computer with a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1265U @1.80 GHz processor and 32 GB RAM takes around **50 hours** for a single cycle.  
However, when run on a Linux server equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz, 48 CPUs, and 252 GB RAM, utilizing multitasking, the processing time is significantly reduced to about **2.5-3 hours**.
