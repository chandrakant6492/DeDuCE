Using the script '1. Deforestation attribution (GEE)-Spatial.ipynb' you will get files in following format and order:
    Forest_loss_to_CLASSIFICATION_Uruguay.csv  # Classification of deforestation associated with different commodity and land-use classes
    Forest_loss_to_AGB_EMISSION_Uruguay.csv    # Deforestation emissions associated with above ground biomass for different commodity and land-use classes
    Forest_loss_to_BGB_EMISSION_Uruguay.csv    # Deforestation emissions associated with below ground biomass for different commodity and land-use classes
    Forest_loss_to_PEATLAND_Uruguay.csv        # Deforestation on peatlands assocaited with for different commodity and land-use classes
    Forest_loss_to_SOC_0_30_Uruguay.csv        # Deforestation emissions associated with soil organic carbon for the top 30 cm for different commodity and land-use classes
    Forest_loss_to_SOC_30_100_Uruguay.csv      # Deforestation emissions associated with soil organic carbon for the 30-100 cm for different commodity and land-use classes
